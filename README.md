# Module 5 Challenge: Pymaceuticals Inc. - Pharmaceutical Drug Analysis

## Overview

In this analysis, the effectiveness of various drug regimens in reducing tumor growth in mice is explored. Using Python and data analysis libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib, the impact of different drug treatments on tumor volume and mouse weight is investigated. 

## Data Sources

The analysis is based on two primary datasets:

1. **Mouse Metadata**
2. **Study Results**

## Data Cleaning and Exploration

Merged the two datasets into a single DataFrame to eliminate duplicate entries.

## Summary Statistics

Provided insights into the central tendency and variability of tumor volume for each drug regimen by calculating mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM.

## Data Visualization

Visualizations included a bar chart displaying mice distribution among different drug regimens.

A pie chart illustrates the gender distribution of the mice in the study.

## Quartiles, Outliers, and Boxplots

Quartiles, IQR, and potential outliers were calculated, and box and whisker plots were created to visualize tumor volume distributions.

## Line and Scatter Plots

A line plot tracked tumor volume over time for a mouse treated with Capomulin.

A scatter plot explored the relationship between mouse weight and average tumor volume for Capomulin-treated mice.

## Correlation and Regression

Linear regression modeling and visualization demonstrated the relationship between mouse weight and tumor volume.
